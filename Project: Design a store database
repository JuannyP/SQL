# For this project, I created a table to practice ORDER BY and AVG commands.
# The table has made up data as if it was an operating boutique.
# I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


CREATE table boutique (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, price INTEGER, available INTEGER, sold INTEGER);
INSERT into boutique VALUES (1,"dresses",15, 10,30);
INSERT into boutique Values (2,"skirts",10,25,15);
INSERT into boutique values (3,"shirts",20,30,50);
Insert into boutique values(4,"socks",5,10,15);
insert into boutique values(5,"caps",10,3,21);

select item, price from boutique ORDER BY price;
select AVG (sold) from boutique;
